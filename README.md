# Diplomatic Echoes: A Textual Analysis of White House and European Commission Communications on Ukraine

This project was developed as a final project for the Introduction to Text Mining and Natural Language Processing class at the Barcelona School of Economics.

## Abstract:
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the official communications from the leaders of the White House and the European Commission to quantify and understand the impact of the Russia's war against Ukraine on their respective communication strategies. Through a combination of techniques including examining mentions of Ukraine, employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic analysis, and applying Granger Causality Tests, the study reveals distinct trends in how each entity discusses the conflict. Findings suggest that the European Commission tends to follow the White Houseâ€™s lead in terms of the frequency and context in which Ukraine is mentioned. This comparative study sheds light on the intricacies of diplomatic communication during an international crisis, providing valuable insights into the coordination and emphasis placed on Ukraine by its two allies.
